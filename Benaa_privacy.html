            <h1>Benaa</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Privacy Policy & Terms of Service</p>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>
            
            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Benaa ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application ("App").</p>
            
            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>Benaa is designed with privacy as a core principle. The App operates entirely offline and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers.</p>
            <p>The only data stored by the App includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Issue reports that you create, including titles, descriptions, and categories</li>
                <li>Photos that you optionally attach to issue reports</li>
                <li>Status updates and comments you add to issues</li>
                <li>Analytics data calculated locally from your issue reports</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of this data is stored exclusively on your device using local storage. No data is transmitted to our servers, third-party services, or any external systems.</p>
            
            <h3>Use of Data</h3>
            <p>The data you create in Benaa is used solely within the App to provide the following functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Display and manage your issue reports</li>
                <li>Track issue status and history</li>
                <li>Generate local analytics and statistics</li>
                <li>Store photos attached to issues</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not use your data for advertising, marketing, analytics tracking, or any other purpose beyond the core functionality of the App.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>Benaa does not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties. All data remains on your device and is never sent to external servers or services.</p>
            <p>Since the App does not require internet connectivity or user accounts, there is no mechanism for data synchronization or sharing between devices or users.</p>
            
            <h3>Ads & Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>Benaa does not display advertisements and does not integrate with any third-party advertising networks or analytics services.</p>
            <p>The App uses the following third-party libraries for core functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Image Picker: Used to access your device's camera and photo library when you choose to attach photos to issues. This access is requested only when you explicitly choose to add a photo.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These libraries operate according to their respective privacy policies, but Benaa does not transmit any data through these services.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Security</h3>
            <p>All data stored by Benaa is protected by your device's standard security measures. Data is stored locally using your device's secure storage system and is not accessible to other apps unless you explicitly share it.</p>
            <p>Since no data is transmitted over the internet, there is no risk of data interception during transmission.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
            <p>Your data remains on your device until you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Delete individual issues within the App</li>
                <li>Uninstall the App, which will remove all stored data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not have access to your data and therefore cannot delete it on your behalf. If you uninstall the App, all data will be permanently removed from your device and cannot be recovered.</p>
            
            <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>Benaa does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since the App does not collect any personal information and operates entirely offline, it is safe for users of all ages. However, we recommend that children under 13 use the App with parental supervision.</p>
            
            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>View all your data within the App</li>
                <li>Edit or delete any issue at any time</li>
                <li>Remove photos from issues</li>
                <li>Delete all data by uninstalling the App</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
            <p>If we make significant changes to how we handle data, we will notify users through the App or other appropriate means.</p>
