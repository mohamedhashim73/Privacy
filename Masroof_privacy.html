        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 2024</p>
        
        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Masroof ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>Masroof is an offline-only application that operates entirely on your device. We collect and store the following information locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expense Data:</strong> Amount, category (Coffee, Transport, Food, Subscriptions, Other), optional notes, and timestamps for each expense you create</li>
            <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, location, or any other personally identifiable information</li>
            <li><strong>No Account Data:</strong> Masroof does not require account creation or authentication</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Data Storage</h3>
        <p>All expense data is stored locally on your device using the device's local storage system (SharedPreferences). This data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers</li>
            <li>Is not backed up to cloud services by our application</li>
            <li>Can be deleted at any time by uninstalling the application or clearing app data</li>
            <li>Is accessible only to you through the application</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Use of Data</h3>
        <p>Your expense data is used solely within the Masroof application to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Display your expense history and list</li>
            <li>Calculate spending totals (today, this week, this month)</li>
            <li>Generate category breakdowns and analytics</li>
            <li>Provide smart insights about your spending patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your data for advertising, marketing, or any other purposes.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advertising networks</li>

        <p>Your data remains private and local to your device.</p>
        
        <h3>Ads & Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>Masroof does not display advertisements and does not integrate with any third-party advertising or analytics services. The application operates independently without external service dependencies.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data security depends on your device's security measures</li>
            <li>We recommend using device lock screens, encryption, and other device security features</li>
            <li>If you share your device with others, they may be able to access your expense data</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the application will permanently delete all stored expense data</li>
        </ul>
