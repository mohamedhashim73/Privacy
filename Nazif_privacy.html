            <p>Privacy Policy & Terms of Service</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 2024</p>
            
            <p>Nazif ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use the Nazif mobile application (the "App").</p>

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Nazif is an offline-only application. All data you create and store remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers or third parties.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
            <p>Nazif collects the following information locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cleaning Tasks:</strong> Task names, assigned areas (stairs, entrance, garage, roof), status (pending or completed), dates, and completion timestamps</li>
                <li><strong>Service Feedback:</strong> Ratings (1-5 stars), comments, timestamps, and optional task associations</li>
                <li><strong>Task History:</strong> Historical records of completed cleaning tasks</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>What We Do NOT Collect:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
                <li>Location data or GPS information</li>
                <li>Device identifiers or unique device IDs</li>
                <li>Analytics or usage statistics</li>
                <li>Crash reports or error logs</li>
                <li>Contact information or address book data</li>
                <li>Photos, videos, or media files</li>
                <li>Financial or payment information</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Use of Data</h3>
            <p>All data collected by Nazif is used exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To provide and maintain the cleaning task tracking functionality</li>
                <li>To display your task history and weekly schedules</li>
                <li>To store and display service feedback and ratings</li>
                <li>To enable app features such as task management and scheduling</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your data is processed entirely on your device. We do not have access to your data, and it is not transmitted to our servers or any third-party services.</p>

            <h3>3. Data Storage</h3>
            <p>Nazif uses local device storage (SharedPreferences) to store all your data. This means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All data is stored securely on your device only</li>
                <li>Data is not synchronized to the cloud or external servers</li>
                <li>Data remains private and accessible only to you</li>
                <li>If you uninstall the app, all stored data will be deleted</li>
                <li>If you clear app data through your device settings, all stored information will be removed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>We do not share, sell, trade, or rent your data to third parties. Since all data is stored locally on your device, we do not have access to your information and therefore cannot share it.</p>

            <p>Your data is never transmitted over the internet, uploaded to cloud services, or accessed by external parties.</p>

            <h3>5. Ads & Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>Nazif does not display advertisements, integrate third-party analytics, use tracking technologies, or include any third-party services that would access your data.</p>

            <p>The app operates completely offline and does not require internet connectivity for its core functionality.</p>

            <h3>6. Data Security</h3>
            <p>Since all your data is stored locally on your device, its security depends on your device's security measures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use device lock features (PIN, password, fingerprint, face recognition)</li>
                <li>Keep your device's operating system updated</li>
                <li>Be cautious when granting permissions to other apps</li>
                <li>Consider using encryption if available on your device</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We recommend taking standard precautions to protect your device, as any unauthorized access to your device could potentially access the data stored by Nazif.</p>

            <h3>7. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>Nazif is intended for use by individuals managing cleaning services in apartment buildings. While the app does not require age verification or collect personal information, we recommend that children under 13 years of age use the app under parental supervision.</p>

            <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information to Nazif, please note that all data is stored locally on the device and can be deleted by uninstalling the app or clearing app data.</p>

            <h3>8. Your Rights</h3>
            <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view all your data within the app at any time</li>
                <li><strong>Modify:</strong> You can edit or delete tasks and feedback directly in the app</li>
                <li><strong>Delete:</strong> You can delete all data by using the "Clear All Data" option in Settings, or by uninstalling the app</li>
                <li><strong>Export:</strong> Currently, the app does not provide data export functionality</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.</p>

            <p>If we make material changes to how we handle data, we will notify users through an app update or other reasonable means. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
