            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            
            <p>FixIt ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>
            
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Important:</strong> FixIt operates entirely offline. All data you create in the app is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to external servers or third parties.
            </div>

            <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
            <p>FixIt collects and stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Maintenance Requests:</strong> Titles, descriptions, categories (Electricity, Water, Elevator, Other), priority levels (High, Medium, Low), and status information (Pending, In Progress, Completed)</li>
                <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Images you choose to attach to maintenance requests, stored locally on your device</li>
                <li><strong>Timestamps:</strong> Creation and update dates for your maintenance requests</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number, address)</li>
                <li>Account credentials (the app does not require user accounts)</li>
                <li>Location data</li>
                <li>Device identifiers</li>
                <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
                <li>Any information transmitted to external servers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Use of Data</h3>
            <p>All data collected by FixIt is used solely to provide the app's functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To store and display your maintenance requests</li>
                <li>To allow you to track the status of your requests</li>
                <li>To enable you to attach and view photos with your requests</li>
                <li>To organize requests by category and priority</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your data is processed entirely on your device. We do not have access to your data, and we do not use it for any purpose other than providing the app's core features.</p>

            <h3>3. Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>FixIt does <strong>not</strong> share your data with anyone. Specifically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not transmit data to external servers</li>
                <li>We do not share data with third-party services</li>
                <li>We do not sell or rent your data</li>
                <li>We do not use analytics or tracking services</li>
                <li>We do not integrate with advertising networks</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All your maintenance requests and photos remain on your device and are accessible only to you through the app.</p>

            <h3>4. Ads & Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>FixIt does not display advertisements and does not integrate with any third-party advertising services. The app does not use analytics services, tracking tools, or any external data processing services.</p>

            <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device using the device's standard local storage mechanisms, data security depends on your device's security settings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is stored using your device's secure local storage system</li>
                <li>We recommend using device-level security features such as screen locks and encryption</li>
                <li>If you uninstall the app, all stored data will be removed from your device</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not have access to your device or your data, so we cannot be responsible for device-level security breaches. Please ensure your device is properly secured.</p>

            <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>FixIt is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since the app does not collect personal information and operates entirely offline, there is no risk of collecting information from children.</p>

            <h3>7. Your Rights</h3>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can view all your maintenance requests at any time</li>
                <li>You can edit or delete any maintenance request</li>
                <li>You can delete photos attached to requests</li>
                <li>You can uninstall the app to remove all data from your device</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have questions about your data, please contact us using the information provided at the end of this document.</p>

            <h3>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
