            <strong>Important:</strong> Parky is an offline-only application. All data you create and store within the app remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers or third parties.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Parky ("we," "our," or "us"). Parky is a parking management application designed for apartment buildings. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>
        <p>By using Parky, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Data Collection</h3>
        <p>Parky collects and stores the following types of data locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Parking Slot Information:</strong> Slot numbers, assigned apartment numbers, availability status, and associated vehicle plate numbers.</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Registry Data:</strong> Vehicle plate numbers, owner apartment numbers, vehicle make, model, and color (if provided).</li>
            <li><strong>Violation Reports:</strong> Parking violation descriptions, slot numbers, vehicle plate numbers (if provided), violation timestamps, and optional photos taken through the app's camera feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Notifications:</strong> Notification messages generated by the app for events such as new violations or slot status changes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>We do NOT collect:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
            <li>Location data or GPS coordinates</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or crash reports</li>
            <li>Payment or financial information</li>
            <li>Any data from third-party accounts or services</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>3. Data Storage and Privacy</h3>
        <p>All data collected by Parky is stored exclusively on your device using local storage (SharedPreferences). This means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your data never leaves your device</li>
            <li>We do not have access to your data</li>
            <li>No data is transmitted to external servers</li>
            <li>No data is shared with third parties</li>
            <li>Data persists on your device until you uninstall the app or manually clear app data</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. Camera and Photo Access</h3>
        <p>Parky requests camera and photo library permissions to allow you to take photos when reporting parking violations. This feature is optional. Photos you take are stored locally on your device and are only accessible within the app. We do not access, transmit, or share these photos.</p>
        <p>You can revoke camera or photo library permissions at any time through your device settings, though this will disable the photo capture feature for violation reports.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Use of Data</h3>
        <p>The data collected by Parky is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Managing and displaying parking slot availability</li>
            <li>Maintaining a registry of vehicles and their associated apartments</li>
            <li>Recording and tracking parking violations</li>
            <li>Generating local notifications for app events</li>
            <li>Providing core app functionality</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your data for advertising, marketing, analytics, or any other commercial purposes.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose your data to any third parties. Since all data remains on your device, there is no mechanism for data sharing.</p>
        
        <h3>7. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>Parky uses the following third-party libraries for core functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SharedPreferences:</strong> For local data storage on your device</li>
            <li><strong>Image Picker:</strong> For accessing your device's camera and photo library (only when you choose to take a photo)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These libraries operate locally on your device and do not transmit data to external servers. We do not use advertising networks, analytics services, or any tracking technologies.</p>
        
        <h3>8. Data Security</h3>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, data security depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using device lock screens (PIN, password, fingerprint, or face recognition)</li>
            <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
            <li>Not sharing your device with unauthorized users</li>
            <li>Using app-specific security features if available on your device</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you uninstall Parky, all locally stored data will be permanently deleted.</p>
        
        <h3>9. Your Rights</h3>
        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can view all data stored in the app through the app's interface</li>
            <li>You can edit or delete any data you have created</li>
            <li>You can clear all app data by uninstalling the app or clearing app data through your device settings</li>
            <li>You can revoke camera or photo library permissions at any time</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>10. Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>Parky is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us.
