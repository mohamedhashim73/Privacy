            <h1>Privacy Policy & Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>
            
            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Boxy ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application ("App").</p>
            
            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>Boxy is designed to operate entirely offline. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers or cloud services.</p>
            <p>The App stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Package registration data (apartment numbers, package types, arrival dates and times)</li>
                <li>Package status information (waiting or delivered)</li>
                <li>Delivery confirmation details (receiver names, delivery timestamps)</li>
                <li>In-app notifications</li>
                <li>Optional photos or signatures captured during delivery confirmation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All data is stored locally on your device using local storage mechanisms. No data is transmitted to external servers, cloud services, or third parties.</p>
            
            <h3>Use of Data</h3>
            <p>The data stored locally on your device is used solely to provide the App's functionality, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracking package registrations and deliveries</li>
                <li>Displaying package status and history</li>
                <li>Managing in-app notifications</li>
                <li>Storing optional delivery confirmation photos or signatures</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not use your data for advertising, analytics, or any other purposes beyond the core functionality of the App.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties. All information remains on your device and is never sent to external servers or services.</p>
            
            <h3>Camera and Photo Library Permissions</h3>
            <p>The App requests camera and photo library permissions only when you choose to capture photos or signatures during delivery confirmation. These permissions are optional, and the App functions fully without them. If you grant these permissions, photos and signatures are stored locally on your device only.</p>
            
            <h3>Ads & Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>Boxy does not display advertisements and does not integrate with third-party advertising or analytics services.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Security</h3>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, data security depends on your device's security measures. We recommend using device-level security features such as screen locks and encryption to protect your data.</p>
            
            <h3>Data Deletion</h3>
            <p>You can delete all App data at any time by uninstalling the App from your device. Uninstalling the App will remove all locally stored data, including packages, notifications, and any photos or signatures.</p>
            
            <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>Boxy does not knowingly collect personal information from children. The App is designed for use by building managers and residents in apartment buildings. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>
            
            <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
