        <h1>Privacy Policy & Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 2024</p>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Important:</strong> MyPantry - Home Inventory is a completely offline application. All your inventory data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to any external servers, cloud services, or third parties.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
        <p><strong>We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data.</strong></p>
        <p>MyPantry - Home Inventory operates entirely offline. The app stores your inventory information locally on your device using the device's local database (SQLite). This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Item names, quantities, and categories</li>
            <li>Expiry dates and purchase dates</li>
            <li>Barcode information (if manually entered or simulated)</li>
            <li>Price information and notes</li>
            <li>Item photos (if you choose to add them)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>None of this data leaves your device.</strong> We do not have access to your inventory data, and it is not shared with any third parties, cloud services, or external servers.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Use of Data</h3>
        <p>Since we do not collect any data, there is no data to use, analyze, or process externally. All data processing occurs locally on your device for the sole purpose of managing your home inventory.</p>
        <p>The app uses local notifications to alert you about items expiring soon or running low on stock. These notifications are generated and displayed entirely on your device and do not require any external services.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Data Sharing</h3>
        <p><strong>We do not share any data because we do not collect any data.</strong></p>
        <p>Your inventory data remains on your device and is never shared with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Third-party services</li>
            <li>Cloud storage providers</li>
            <li>Analytics companies</li>
            <li>Advertising networks</li>
            <li>Any external servers or databases</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have the option to export your inventory data as a CSV file, which is saved locally on your device. This export feature is entirely local and does not transmit data anywhere.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Ads & Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>MyPantry - Home Inventory does not display advertisements and does not integrate with any third-party advertising services, analytics platforms, or tracking services.</p>
        <p>The app uses the following local-only services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local Notifications:</strong> Used to alert you about expiring items and low stock. These notifications are generated and displayed entirely on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Database (SQLite):</strong> Used to store your inventory data on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Image Picker:</strong> Allows you to optionally add photos to inventory items. Photos are stored locally on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>None of these services transmit data to external servers.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
        <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your inventory data depends on the security of your device. We recommend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using device lock screens (PIN, password, fingerprint, or face recognition)</li>
            <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
            <li>Using device encryption if available</li>
            <li>Regularly backing up your device if you want to preserve your inventory data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you uninstall the app, all inventory data stored locally will be deleted. We recommend exporting your data as a CSV file before uninstalling if you wish to preserve it.</p>
        
        <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>MyPantry - Home Inventory does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13, as we do not collect any information from anyone. The app is safe for use by all ages, as all data remains on the user's device.</p>
        
        <h3>7. Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated "Last Updated" date. Since the app operates offline, you may need to check for app updates to see the latest version of this policy.</p>
        <p>Your continued use of the app after any changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>
