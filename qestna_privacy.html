        <h1>Privacy Policy & Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 2024</p>
        
        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Qestna ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>Qestna is designed to operate entirely offline and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers. The app stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expense records including title, amount, category, and date</li>
            <li>Apartment information including apartment numbers and payment status</li>
            <li>Payment records including amounts paid and payment dates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal identification information (names, email addresses, phone numbers)</li>
            <li>Device identifiers or unique device IDs</li>
            <li>Location data</li>
            <li>Usage analytics or crash reports</li>
            <li>Any data transmitted over the internet</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Use of Data</h3>
        <p>All data stored by Qestna remains on your device and is used solely to provide the app's functionality. The data you enter is used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Display expense records and summaries</li>
            <li>Track apartment contribution payments</li>
            <li>Generate monthly financial reports and charts</li>
            <li>Maintain your expense history</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not access, view, or process your data in any way. All processing occurs locally on your device.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
        <p>Qestna does not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties. Since all data remains on your device, there is no mechanism for data sharing. We do not have access to your data and cannot share what we do not have access to.</p>
        
        <h3>Ads & Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>Qestna does not display advertisements and does not integrate with any third-party advertising services, analytics platforms, or data collection services. The app operates independently without external service dependencies.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Security</h3>
        <p>Your data is stored locally on your device using Android's SharedPreferences storage system, which is protected by your device's operating system security. We recommend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping your device locked with a secure password or biometric authentication</li>
            <li>Regularly backing up your device if you want to preserve your data</li>
            <li>Using the app's built-in data clearing feature in Settings if you want to remove all data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since data never leaves your device, there is no risk of data breaches from external servers or network transmission.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Retention and Deletion</h3>
        <p>Your data remains on your device until you choose to delete it. You can delete all app data at any time through the Settings screen within the app. Uninstalling the app will also remove all stored data from your device.</p>
        
        <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>Qestna does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Since the app does not collect any personal information and operates entirely offline, it is safe for users of all ages. However, the app is designed for use by apartment building managers and residents who are typically adults.</p>
        
        <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app or on our website. Changes are effective immediately upon posting. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
