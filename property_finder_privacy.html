            <h1>Privacy Policy & Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 2025</p>
            
            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            
            <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            <p>Welcome to PropertyFinder - Local Real Estate ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application. PropertyFinder is a fully offline application designed to help you browse and manage real estate property listings locally on your device.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Data Collection</h3>
            <p><strong>We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information.</strong> PropertyFinder operates entirely offline and does not connect to any external servers, APIs, or cloud services.</p>
            <p>The app stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Property listings you view or interact with</li>
                <li>Your favorite properties (saved locally)</li>
                <li>Any mock properties you create or add through the app</li>
                <li>Your search and filter preferences (stored temporarily in app memory)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>This data never leaves your device</strong> and is stored using local device storage (SQLite database). We have no access to this information.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Use of Data</h3>
            <p>Since we do not collect any data, we do not use, process, or analyze any personal information. All data stored locally on your device is used solely to provide the app's functionality, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Displaying property listings</li>
                <li>Maintaining your favorites list</li>
                <li>Remembering your filter preferences during your session</li>
                <li>Storing mock properties you create</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
            <p><strong>We do not share any data</strong> because we do not collect or transmit any data. PropertyFinder does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, advertising networks, or cloud storage services. All information remains on your device.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Ads & Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>PropertyFinder does not display advertisements and does not integrate with any third-party advertising networks. The app does not use analytics services, crash reporting tools, or any other third-party services that would collect data.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Contact Features</h3>
            <p>The app includes contact simulation features (Call, Message, Email buttons) for demonstration purposes only. These features do not make actual phone calls, send messages, or send emails. They are purely visual demonstrations and do not access your contacts, phone functionality, or email accounts.</p>
            
            <h3>7. Data Security</h3>
            <p>All data stored by PropertyFinder is kept locally on your device using standard mobile device security. We recommend that you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your device's operating system updated</li>
                <li>Use device lock screens and authentication</li>
                <li>Be cautious when sharing your device with others</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data will be deleted from your device.</p>
            
            <h3>8. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>PropertyFinder is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since our app does not collect any information, this policy serves as a general statement of our commitment to privacy protection for all users.</p>
            
            <h3>9. Your Rights</h3>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over it. You can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>View and manage your favorite properties within the app</li>
                <li>Delete properties you have added</li>
                <li>Clear all app data by uninstalling the app</li>
                <li>Use the "Clear All Data" feature within the app to remove all stored properties</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app or on our website. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy indicates when it was last revised.</p>
            <p>You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted.</p>
            
            <h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> This is a demo application. All property listings are mock data for demonstration purposes only. The app does not provide real property listings, and contact features are simulated only.</p>
            
            <h3>3. App Usage</h3>
            <p>You may use PropertyFinder for personal, non-commercial purposes. You agree to:</p>

            <p>You are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintaining the security of your device</li>
                <li>Backing up any data you wish to preserve (data is stored locally and may be lost if the app is uninstalled)</li>
                <li>Understanding that this is a demonstration app with mock data</li>
                <li>Not relying on the app for actual real estate transactions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>5. Mock Data Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>All property listings, images, prices, locations, and contact information in PropertyFinder are mock data created for demonstration purposes. This data is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Not representative of real properties</li>
                <li>Not verified or accurate</li>
                <li>Not intended for actual real estate transactions</li>
                <li>Generated randomly or from templates</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Do not use this app to make real estate purchasing, renting, or investment decisions.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Contact Features</h3>
            <p>The contact features (Call, Message, Email buttons) in PropertyFinder are simulation-only features. They do not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make actual phone calls</li>
                <li>Send real text messages</li>
                <li>Send actual emails</li>
                <li>Access your contacts or communication apps</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These features are included for demonstration purposes to show how a real estate app might function, but they do not perform actual communication functions.</p>
            
            <h3>7. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PROPERTYFINDER IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
