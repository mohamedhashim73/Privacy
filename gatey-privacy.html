            <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            
            <p>All information collected by Gatey is used solely for the following purposes:</p>

                <li>Enabling search and filtering functionality within the app</li>
                <li>Storing your app preferences and settings</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>3. Data Storage and Security</h3>
            
            <p><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All data collected by Gatey is stored exclusively on your device using local storage mechanisms (SharedPreferences). No data is transmitted over the internet, stored on external servers, or synchronized to cloud services.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Data Security:</strong> While we implement standard security practices for local data storage, you are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Securing your device with appropriate access controls (passwords, biometrics)</li>
                <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
                <li>Using the app only on trusted devices</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You can delete all app data at any time by uninstalling the application from your device. All visitor logs and settings will be permanently removed.</p>
            
            <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
            
            <p><strong>We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties.</strong> Since all data remains on your device, there is no mechanism for data sharing, cloud synchronization, or external data transmission.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
            
            <p>Gatey does not integrate with third-party analytics services, advertising networks, or data collection platforms. The app operates entirely offline and does not communicate with external servers.</p>
            
            <p>The app uses the following open-source libraries for core functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flutter framework (Google) - for app development</li>
                <li>Provider package - for state management</li>
                <li>SharedPreferences - for local data storage</li>
                <li>Intl package - for date and time formatting</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These libraries are used solely for app functionality and do not collect or transmit user data.</p>
            
            <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
            
            <p>Gatey is designed for use by building security personnel and property managers. The app does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age. If you believe that a child has provided information through the app, please contact us immediately.</p>
            
            <h3>7. Your Rights</h3>
            
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view all visitor logs and data within the app</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
