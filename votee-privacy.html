            <h1>Privacy Policy & Terms of Service</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 23, 2026</p>
            
            <h2>1. Privacy Policy</h2>
            
            <h3>1.1 Introduction</h3>
            <p>Votee ("we," "our," or "us") is a voting and decision-making application designed for apartment residents. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.</p>
            
            <h3>1.2 Data Collection</h3>
            <p>Votee is designed to operate entirely offline. All data is stored locally on your device using your device's local storage system. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Data Stored Locally on Your Device:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apartment ID:</strong> A unique identifier you provide to distinguish your apartment unit for voting purposes. This is stored only on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Poll Data:</strong> Poll questions, options, votes, and results created within the app. This includes polls you create (if using Admin Mode) and polls you vote on.</li>
                <li><strong>Admin Mode Setting:</strong> A local preference indicating whether Admin Mode is enabled on your device.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Data We Do NOT Collect:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
                <li>Location data</li>
                <li>Device identifiers</li>
                <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
                <li>Any data transmitted to external servers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>1.3 Use of Data</h3>
            <p>All data stored in Votee is used solely for the app's core functionality:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To enable voting on polls within your apartment community</li>
                <li>To prevent duplicate votes from the same apartment ID</li>
                <li>To display poll results and history</li>
                <li>To manage Admin Mode functionality for poll creation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not use your data for advertising, marketing, analytics, or any other purpose beyond the app's core voting functionality.</p>
            
            <h3>1.4 Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>Votee does not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties. All data remains on your device and is never sent to external servers, cloud services, or third-party services.</p>
            
            <h3>1.5 Data Security</h3>
            <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, data security depends on your device's security measures. We recommend:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
                <li>Using device lock screen protection</li>
                <li>Being cautious when sharing your device with others</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you uninstall the app, all locally stored data will be deleted from your device.</p>
            
            <h3>1.6 Data Retention</h3>
            <p>Data is retained on your device for as long as the app is installed. You can clear all app data at any time by uninstalling the app or clearing the app's data through your device settings.</p>
            
            <h3>1.7 Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>Votee is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Since our app operates entirely offline and does not collect personal information, this is not applicable to our current functionality.</p>
            
            <h3>1.8 Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the app and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
            
            <h3>1.9 Ads & Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>Votee does not display advertisements and does not integrate with any third-party advertising or analytics services. The app uses only essential Flutter framework components and local storage functionality.</p>
            
            <h3>1.10 Cookies and Tracking</h3>
            <p>Votee does not use cookies, web beacons, or any tracking technologies. The app operates entirely offline and does not access the internet.</p>
